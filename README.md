### Project: Periodic Table

**Description:**
My first coding project involved creating a Periodic Table using only HTML. This project was pivotal in my coding journey as it helped me grasp fundamental concepts such as HTML table structure and its child tags. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in organizing elements, understanding table semantics, and creating a structured layout using basic HTML elements.

**Skills Learned:**
- HTML
- Table Structure
- Semantic HTML
